# Connect 2

Connect 2 is a reimagined 2D social media platform that transforms how users interact online. Moving beyond the conventional one-directional scrolling, Connect 2 introduces **"spaces"**, virtual environments where users can freely explore, engage, and connect with others, replicating real-life social interactions.

Developed by Arunav, Ethan, Fume, Gavin, Hailey and Zuhair during the D.O. IT (Don't Overthink It) Hackathon 2024, Connect 2 was built using cutting-edge technologies like React, Vite, TypeScript, and Figma to offer a faster, more immersive social experience. On the backend, **PocketBase (PockDB)** is used to manage real-time data and user interactions efficiently.

## The Concept of Spaces

Traditional social media platforms are based on a linear, algorithm-driven feed where users scroll either up or down to view content. Connect 2 breaks away from this model by introducing **spaces**—virtual environments that mimic real-world social dynamics.


### What are Spaces?

In Connect 2, spaces represent different virtual rooms where users can move around, meet others, and participate in various discussions. This concept is inspired by real-life interactions, where you can physically move through a room, choose whom to talk to, and join ongoing conversations.

- **Explore Freely**: Instead of mindlessly scrolling, users can navigate through spaces and interact with content at their own pace, choosing where they want to engage.
- **Humanlike Socialization**: Spaces encourage real-time, spontaneous conversations and group interactions, creating a more authentic social experience.
- **Immersive and Interactive**: Whether it's chatting one-on-one or joining larger group discussions, users can interact in a way that feels natural and social, much like being in a physical environment.
Connect 2 aims to replicate the fluidity and richness of in-person interactions, providing a more social and engaging platform than traditional media.

## Features
